EXERCISES

The following exercises suggest you connect to host csc.canberra.edu.au. 
You can connect to other hosts (including your own) if you wish. You might 
also wish to redirect SNMP output to a file, so that you have a record of 
variable contents for later study.

1.	The System Group
	- Access all of the variables in this group.
	- Interpret their contents.

2.      The Interfaces Group
	- Access all of the variables in this group. 
	- How many interfaces does host CSC contain ?
	- How many entries does the Interfaces Table contain ?

3.	The IP Group
	- Is machine CSC a Host or a Gateway ?
	- How many unknown packet types had CSC received ?
	- What is CSC's default route ?
	- Does CSC support RIP ?

4.	The TCP Group
	- Which well-known port numbers does CSC support ?
	- In which state is the CSC TCP Echo Port ?

5.	The UDP Group
	- Which well-known port numbers does CSC support ?
6.	Improvements

By now you will have realised that the shell allows you to access all SNMP 
variables, but that finding desired information and formatting that 
information for use by a manager is rather tedious. Describe a paradigm 
which improves ease of access and formatting. Hint: see Chapter 7 of 
"The Simple Book" by Marshall T. Rose.
