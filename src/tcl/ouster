COMMENTS ON TCL BOOK ouster@cs.berkeley.edu
        The book is lacking in theoretical background on the design and 
implementation of User Interfaces. A chapter on User Interface Design 
followed by a chapter on the Implementation of Tcl would greatly enhance
the value of the book. Such information would also ease the porting of Tcl
to other environments. (I am currently porting Tcl to Douglas Comer's XINU
Operating System).
