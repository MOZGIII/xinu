1. About ParaXinu.

ParaXinu is a derivative of XINU learning OS. It's based on sources of XINU 7.9,
but runs underl Linux instead of DOS and can be compiled with modern compilers.
ParaXinu was created specially for use by stundents of Moscow State Industrial
University (www.msiu.ru).

xinu.exe   -- Executable file of ParaXinu OS

3. Compiling ParaXinu.
ParaXinu was modified to be built by GCC 4.x. It was tested with GCC 4.1.2 on
Debian 4.1.1-21, but should also work with other GCC 3.x and 4.x compilers
without further modifications.

Additionally, to compile Xinu you need NASM assembler and NCurses library for
shell.

To compile Xinu, just type 'make' (without quotes) in this directory.

XINU should partially compatible with "-ansi" switch to GCC, but sigaction
would not compile this way. Also, XINU should be fully compatible with
"-pedantic" switch.

4. Using Xinu.
After you run xinu.exe, Xinu will initialize its devices and processes and show
some information about memory. After that, Xinu will execute user function, 
xmain, which is placed into xinu.c. By default, this function runs login
procedure, but you can changed it to anything you want.

Currently, Xinu only accepts one login, which is hard-coded into login() 
function. This login is 'dc'. No password is needed.

After succesful login, Xinu will fire up its command shell, which first will
read and execute commands from 'startup' script and then go into interactive
mode. To get list of commands in this mode, type 'help' or 'man' or '?'. To
get help about particular command, type 'help' or 'man' followed by the name
of command (help is only available for some shell commands).

ONLY PORTED it to Linux from DOS.
