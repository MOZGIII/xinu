BUTLER(1)            PCXinu 7.9 Programmer's Manual              BUTLER(1)

NAME
        butler - show process information and semaphore information

SYNOPSIS
        butler

DESCRIPTION
        Butler extracts information from the process table and formats
        it in a readable form. Each line of output contains information
        about a single process and shows pid, pstate, pprio, pname, sp,
        ss, top of stack, di, si, flags and bp.

        Butler also displays the PRWAIT, PRREADY and PRSLEEP semaphore
        queues.

NOTES
        Butler does not know about the recvtim state and thus flags it
        as an invalid state.

        The semaphore queue linkages are checked and errors noted.

        The information about the current process is out of date.

SEE ALSO
        ps(1), kill(1)
