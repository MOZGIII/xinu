NAME
        cat - concatenate files and write to standard output

SYNOPSIS
        cat [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
        cat concatenates a set of files by opening each file in turn
        and writing its contents to standard output. Because standard
        output normally goes to the window in which the shell runs,
        invoking cat on a single file causes the contents of the file
        to be written on the screen.

NOTES
        Shell redirection can be used to combine files into a single
        file: cat file1 file2 >file3

        cat >file can be used to generate a file from keyboard input.
        Ctrl-D will close the file and terminate the command.

        cp(1), echo(1)
