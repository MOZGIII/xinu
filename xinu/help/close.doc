CLOSE(1)            PCXinu 7.9 Programmer's Manual              CLOSE(1)

NAME
        close - close a device descriptor

SYNOPSIS
        close device

DESCRIPTION
        close takes as an argument a device descriptor and invokes the
        system call close on that device. Each device has a reference
        count that is incremented by the system call open and decremented
        by the system call close. Thus, if the device has been opened
        n times, the user must invoke the close command n times to close it.
