NAME
        color - change color parameters for the standard output window

SYNOPSIS
        color [attr]

DESCRIPTION
        Without any arguments, color changes the color of the standard
        output window to white on black. If an attribute string is given,
        the color of the standard output window is changed. When used with
        a black and white monitor, all colors except white map to black.

        An attribute string has the format "fff/bbb" in which 'fff' and
        'bbb' are three-character color codes representing the foreground
        and background colors to be used with a color display. The color
        codes are shown below:

                                blk     black
                                blu     blue
                                grn     green
                                cyn     cyan
                                red     red
                                mag     magenta
                                yel     yellow
                                wht     white

        The 'fff' or 'bbb' fields may be replaced by a single decimal
        digit in the range 0..7.

        The color codes may be preceded by optional blink or intensify
        specifiers in the attribute string. The specifiers are:

        '?' blink on  '*' blink off  '+' intensity on  '-' intensity off
