NAME
        date, time - print the current time and date

SYNOPSIS
        date

        time

DESCRIPTION
        Date extracts the time and date from the operating system and
        formats it in a readable form. PCXinu gets the time from a time
        server (if available), otherwise the DOS time is returned.

        Time is a synonym for the same function as date.
