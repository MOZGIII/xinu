NAME
        dgstat - print information on current datagram pseudo-devices.

SYNOPSIS
        dgstat

DESCRIPTION
        Dgstat extracts information from datagram control blocks and
        formats it in a readable form. Each line of output contains
        information about an open UDP datagram pseudo-device. Columns
        give the device number, device mode, Xinu port number, process
        name, foreign IP address, foreign and local UDP port numbers.

NOTES
        The device mode specifies whether Xinugrams or Datagrams are to
        be passed to the receiving process. An optional timeout bit can
        also be set.
