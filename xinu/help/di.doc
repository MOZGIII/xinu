DI(1)             PCXinu 7.9 Programmer's Manual               DI(1)

NAME
        di - initialize a device

SYNOPSIS
        di devicename

DESCRIPTION
        Di initializes the specified device after first uninitializing
        the device. Di can be used to reinitialize the PCXinu disk device
        if the system was booted without a disk in the DOS A: drive. The
        line printer device can also be reinitialized.

BUGS
        Other devices should not be reinitialized because the uninitializing
        of certain devices has not been fully implemented.
