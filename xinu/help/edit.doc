EDIT(1)            PCXinu 7.9 Programmer's Manual              EDIT(1)

NAME
        edit - edit a file in a window

SYNOPSIS
        edit [file]

DESCRIPTION
        Edit is an ultra-simple text editor. It is intended for writing
        short TCL and Shell command scripts. Edit understands all the
        cursor positioning keys on a PC keyboard plus a few commands:
        
                ctrl-s          show editor status on status device
                ctrl-y          delete line
                ESC             exit editor, save file if necessary
        
        The diamond character indicates EOF. 
        
NOTES
        Edit does not accept STDOUT or STDIN redirection. 
        Edit uses a function called show, which writes directly to video
        RAM (nasty, but necessary for performance reasons).
