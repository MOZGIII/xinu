SH(1)               PCXinu 7.9 Programmer's Manual                 SH(1)

NAME
        sh - invoke a subshell to interpret commands

SYNOPSIS
        sh [filename]
        sh [-c 'command']

DESCRIPTION
        sh creates a separate, fresh invocation of the command interpreter.
        If a filename is specified, shell reads and executes the commands in
        the file. If the first line of the file contains #!tcl -f the shell
        starts the TCL interpreter, which executes the TCL script.
        An argument -c forces the shell to take its input from the
        second argument. sh is most useful for executing command scripts with
        the input taken from a file or another window. However, recursive
        invocation of the shell works as expected - the user interacts with
        the innermost (most recent) shell, returning to the next outer shell
        after the inner shell terminates.

CAUTION
        If the shell reads commands from a file, the file size must NOT be
        greater than 512 bytes.

SEE ALSO
        exit(1), shell(1), tcl(1)
