DESCRIPTION
        Snmp opens a subshell which supports the following syntax:
                exit
                agent name
                [object-name]+
                next [object-name]+
                set [object-name type value]+
        Type:   [int | counter | gauge | timeticks | str | objid | ipaddr]
        Control characters:     TAB     print next object-name
                                ctrl-n  get next object
                                ctrl-w  kill word
        The SNMP shell is used to view or set MIB variables at an agent.
        Variables can be partly specified, TAB will complete them. 
        Note that only certain MIB variables are alterable.
