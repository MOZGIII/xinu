TCL(1)              PCXinu 7.9 Programmer's Manual              TCL(1)

NAME
        tcl - Tcl 6.7 command language interpreter

SYNOPSIS
        tcl [filename]
        tclsh

DESCRIPTION
        This Xinu adaptation of John Ousterhout's Tool Command Language
        supports many features of TCL as described in "Tcl and the Tk 
        Toolkit" (Addison-Wesley 1994).
        Tcl can be invoked from the shell with an argument specifying
        the name of a Tcl Script. If a Tcl script contains #!tcl in its
        first line, the filename can be typed directly to the shell, and
        the Tcl interpreter is invoked automatically. Arguments are passed
        as expected.

NOTES
        Not all of the file, exec and open options have been ported.
        Floating-point operations are NOT supported.
        SNMP Tcl commands will be available soon.
