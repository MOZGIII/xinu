UDP(4)              Xinu Programmer's Manual               UDP(4)

NAME
     udp - UDP-level Internet interface pseudo-device driver
     (types dgm, dg)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <network.h>

     read(device buffer, length)
     write(device, buffer, length)
     open(device, name)
     close(device)
     control(device, function, arg1)
     init(device)

DESCRIPTION
     The dgm and dg device drivers, which operate as a related
     pair, provide a network interface at the IP datagram level.
     They accept datagrams from user processes and send them out
     on the DARPA Internet, or receive datagrams from the Inter-
     net and deliver them to user processes.  The standard Xinu
     device name for the datagram master pseudo-device is UDP,
     and the standard name for individual connection pseudo-
     devices is DGRAM.

     The drivers cooperate so that users can initiate connection
     by calling OPEN(2) on the datagram master device.  If suc-
     cessful, the call to OPEN(2) returns the device descriptor
     of a dg pseudo-device that can be used with READ(2) or
     WRITE(2) to transfer data.  Finally, when finished with the
     connection, the user process calls CLOSE(2) on the dg dev-
     ice.

     The dgm driver consists of routines that implement OPEN(2)
     and CONTROL(2), while the dg driver consists of routines for
     READ(2), WRITE(2), CLOSE(2), and CONTROL(2).  Primitives
     READ(2) and WRITE(2) operate in one of two basic modes.
     Either they transfer data in Xinugram format complete with
     an address header, or they transfer just the data portion of
     the datagram.

     open(device,name,mode)
          Used with the master device to open a datagram pseudo-
          device.  Name is a string that gives an IP address and
          UDP port number in the form i1.i2.i3.i4:u.

     control(device,function,arg1)
          No control operations are supported for the master dev-
          ice.

     Used with a dg pseudo-device to set the transfer mode.  The
     valid operations include DG_CLEAR, which clears any UDP
     datagrams that happen to be in the receive queue, and
     DG_SETMODE, which sets the pseudo-device mode.  The mode
     argument composed of a word in which the first two bits con-
     trol the transfer mode and sixth bit controls timeout.  The
     symbolic constants for these bits are:
       DG_NMODE (001) - Normal mode
       DG_DMODE (002) - Data-only mode
       DG_TMODE (004) - Timeout all reads
       DG_CMODE (010) - Generate UDP checksums (default on)

     read(device buffer, length)
          Used with a dg pseudo-device to await the arrival of a
          UDP datagram and transfer it to the user in the form of
          a Xinugram.

     write(device, buffer, length)
          Used with a dg pseudo-device to transfer a xinugram
          into a UDP datagram and send it on the Internet.

     close(device)
          Closes a dg pseudo-device.

     init(device)
          When applied to dg pseudo-devices initializes each to
          mark it not in use.
